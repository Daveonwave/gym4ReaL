# Gym4ReaL

Over the past decades, reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in the research community. However, the majority of benchmark tasks used to evaluate novel RL algorithms are still based on toy problems or virtual environments. A well-known limitation in RL research is that success in these artificial settings does not readily translate to effectiveness in real-world applications, affected by uncertainty, physical constraints, and human-world limitations. In this paper, we introduce Gym4ReaL, a comprehensive suite of realistic environments designed to support the development and evaluation of RL algorithms in real-world scenarios. The suite includes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of practical challenges. Our experimental results show that standard, off-the-shelf RL algorithms still fall short in these settings, highlighting the need for new methods capable of tackling the complexities of real-world tasks.
